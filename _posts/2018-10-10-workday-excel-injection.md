Workday is a great app for HR, but it is also great for spreading malicious code.<br>

You can export almost anything to excel, this includes a vulnerable "Layout name". You can insert excel command into this field to open command console :) <br>

Though it has a built-in filter to sanitize basic functions like "=cmd|", but it can be bypassed with "=2+5+cmd|".

Append your favourite commands, then your colleagues' computer is under your control :)

Workday said it is fixed.
